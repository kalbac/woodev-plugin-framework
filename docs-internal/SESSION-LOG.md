# Session Log — Woodev Plugin Framework

## s1 (2026-05-09): AGENTS.md created, CLAUDE.md refactored, docs-internal/ finalized
- Created AGENTS.md — common entry point for ALL AI agents (modeled after woodev_theme)
- Refactored CLAUDE.md — now extends AGENTS.md with Claude-specific MCP rules (Serena, Context7)
- Expanded Documentation Structure section in both AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md with explicit "Working with" instructions:
  - Public docs (`docs/`): mkdocs build, `%%FRAMEWORK_VERSION%%` injection, markdownlint, GH Pages deploy
  - Internal docs (`docs-internal/`): no build step, gotcha recording protocol, session logging, ADR template
- Updated QWEN.md — Documentation Structure and Knowledge Persistence sections
- Updated .gitignore: added `/_site/` (mkdocs artifact) + docs-internal/ tracking comment
- Updated .markdownlintignore: excluded docs-internal/SESSION-LOG.md, GOTCHAS.md, CURRENT-STATE.md
- Key decision: Two-tier doc architecture — `docs/` (GH Pages public) strictly separated from `docs-internal/` (AI agents internal)
- Build: n/a (docs/restructure only, no code changes)

## s0 (2026-05-09): docs-internal/ structure initialized
- Created docs-internal/ directory for internal technical documentation
- Separated public docs (docs/ → GH Pages) from internal docs (docs-internal/ → AI agents)
- Setup: DOCS-INDEX.md, DOCS-SCHEMA.md, AGENT-RULES.md, CURRENT-STATE.md, SESSION-LOG.md, GOTCHAS.md, FUTURE-BACKLOG.md
- Created subdirectories: gotchas/, adr/, archive/, wiki/
- Updated gateway files (CLAUDE.md, QWEN.md) to reference docs-internal/
- Added _site/ to .gitignore
- Build: n/a (docs only)
