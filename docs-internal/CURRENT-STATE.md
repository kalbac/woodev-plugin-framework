3. ~~Clean up PHPStan baseline~~ ✅ s3
4. ~~eCheck/ACH audit + removal~~ ✅ s3
5. Extract traits from class-payment-gateway.php (now 2378 lines, down from 3927)

## Planned — v2.0.0 & Beyond

> Detailed specs in `docs-internal/FUTURE-BACKLOG.md`

| # | Task | Category | Target |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Bump WP/WC minimums (WP 6.3+, WC 7.0+) + remove deprecated compat code | ✅ Done | v2.0.0 |
| 2 | Remove unused US-specific payment types (echeck, Apple Pay, Google Pay) | ✅ Done | v2.0.0 |
| 3 | Push notifications & webhooks (server→client) | Feature | Post v2.0.0 |
| 4 | Shipping module boilerplate | Feature | Post v2.0.0 |
| 5 | React-oriented admin UI | Feature | Post v2.0.0 |
| 6 | Framework decoupling — support pure WP plugins + future EDD | Architecture | v2.0.0 |
| 7 | Cross-project ecosystem orchestration ("Оркестрация экосистемы Woodev") | Cross-Project | Post v2.0.0 stable |

> **v2.0.0 execution order:** #1 → #2 (cleanup legacy) → #6 (architectural split). Features #3–#5 post v2.0.0. **#7 is a cross-project initiative that unlocks only after v2.0.0 is shipped AND stable — see Cross-Project Reminders below.**

## 🔔 Cross-Project Reminders

> **For the agent reading this on session start:** if any item in this section is triggered, surface it in your session opening summary so Maksim is reminded.

### Post-v2.0.0 Trigger — Ecosystem Orchestration

- **Status:** dormant — waiting for Framework v2.0.0 to ship and stabilize
- **Trigger condition:** when v2.0.0 tasks #1, #2, #6 are all marked ✅ in the Phase Status table AND v2.0.0 has been live for several weeks without major regressions
- **What to remind Maksim about:** the concept spec **"Оркестрация экосистемы Woodev"** — system-wide automation across all Woodev projects (framework, ~12 plugins, woodev-theme, n8n automations, marketing/content). Goal: zero unnecessary human in the change-propagation flow
- **Spec location:** `D:\Projects\woodev_theme\docs\superpowers\specs\2026-05-13-woodev-ecosystem-orchestration-spec.md`
- **Why this lives in this project's docs:** Framework v2.0 is the gating prerequisite for the orchestration work. The reminder belongs where v2.0 progress is tracked
- **What the agent must do when trigger fires:**
  1. Mention the reminder in the session opening summary — do NOT bury it
  2. Do **NOT** auto-start implementation work
  3. Point Maksim to the spec file above and ask whether he wants to revisit it now
  4. If yes — read the spec's "Prompt for the Future Agent" section first (it has explicit anti-implementation instructions)
- **Cross-reference:** `FUTURE-BACKLOG.md` → "Cross-Project Initiatives" → #7

## Active Queue

> Platform v2 resolver facade + explicit loader definition slice is complete. Phase 3 has moved WooCommerce hook ownership, initial `supported_features`/Blocks handler construction, WooCommerce system-status row ownership, WooCommerce logger ownership, and WooCommerce template loader ownership into `Woodev_Woocommerce_Plugin`. Next step: continue Phase 3 with another small tested slice of WooCommerce runtime ownership; do not expand resolver into runtime behavior or rewrite production plugin loaders before migration contracts.

## Infrastructure Reference

- **Framework version:** Woodev_Plugin::VERSION (in woodev/class-plugin.php)
- **PHP target:** 8.1 (composer platform)
- **WP minimum:** 6.3
- **WC minimum:** 7.0
- **Test framework:** Brain Monkey (unit) + WP Test Library (integration)
- **CI:** GitHub Actions (docs.yml, markdown-lint.yml, release workflow)
